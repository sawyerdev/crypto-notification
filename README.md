A simple system to receive email notification when a new value of BEP20 (Binance Smart Chain) tokens is received.

Currently, many platforms already use cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. But they are not always immediate, and it may take a few hours or even days for you to receive the amount. Going through a similar situation and to not have to keep looking at my wallet all the time, I created a simple system to alert me when a new amount of the token that I stipulated is in the wallet.
